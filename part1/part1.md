1. It writes the message "3" to the console since there are 3 prices in the list and the variable in the loop end at this point.
2. It writes the message "150" to the console since the last variable i set the value to price of 300, and it has a discounted value of 150 with 0.5 discount.
3. It writes the message "150" to the console since the last variable i set the value to price of 300, and it has a value of 150 after 0.5 discount.
4. It returns a array with value of [50,100,150], which are the discounted prices for each items in the inputlist since the function aim to return the "discounted" value.
5. It will has an error since "i" is defined as a local variable in the loop and could not be acceessed outside the loop
6. It will has an error since "discounted price" is defined as a local variable in the loop and could not be acceessed outside the loop
7. It writes the message "150" to the console since the last variable i set the value to price of 300, and it has a value of 150 after 0.5 discount.
8. It returns a array with value of [50,100,150], which are the discounted prices for each items in the inputlist since the function aim to return the "discounted" value.
9. It will has an error since "i" is defined as a local variable in the loop and could not be acceessed outside the loop
10. It will has an error since "discounted price" is defined as a local constant variable in the loop and could not be acceessed outside the loop
11. It will has an error of reference since we defined "final price" as gloabl constant in the begining of the function but tried to assign a dynamic value in the loop
12. It will return an empty list  based on the "discounted" array depends on the variable "final price" but there is an error to access it. 
13. A. alert(student.name)\
    B. alert(student['Grad Year'])\
    C. student.greeting()\
    D. alert(student['Favorite Teacher'].name)\
    E. alert(student.courseLoad[0])
    
14. A. It will show "32" since '3' is a char and concatenated together with 2 consider as a stirng "32"\
    B. It will show "1" since it consider '3' as integer 3 when doing subtraction and 3-2 result in 1\
    C. it will show 3 since it consider null as 0 value and 3+0 reslut in 3\
    D. it will show in "3null" since it concatenate the char '3' and string "null"\
    E. it will show 4 since it consider the value of "true" as 1 and 3+1=4\
    F. it will show 0 since it consider both "null" and "false" as 0 value and 0+0=0\
    G. it will show "3undefined" since it concatenate the string "3" with "undefined"\ 
    H. it will show "NAN" since the undefined has the value of "NAN" and the subtraction between 3 and "NaN" result in "NAN" as well
    
15. A. it will result in true since '2' has a ascii value of 50 which is greater than 1\
    B. it will result in false since char '2' has a greater ascii value compare to the char '12'\
    C. it will result in true since "==" will only compare the actual value within a char therefore the same as 2==2\
    D. it will result in false since "===" will consider the type of object on both side therefore an integer could not equal to a char\
    E. it will result in false since true has a value of 1 which 1<2\
    F. it will reuslt in true since boolean(2) result in true and true== true
    
16. "==" will convert both side into same type when comparing and only consider the value within string, char, etc.\
    "===" will consider the type of both sides when doing the comparsion and will not convert them into same type
17. It will first go into "if" statement which compare 2 and true and as we mention above it returns false, therefore it goes into the next "else if" statement. Since (2==2) is always ture, it will send the message of "How are you?" to console and end the if statement.
