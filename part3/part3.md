1.The two integers are store as string, and when doing result=num1+num2 it is just concatenate the two strings instead of addition\
2.I changed the line "result=num1+num2" by parseInt the two variables num1, num2 in order to perform the opreation of addition between two integers. Also see the fixed screenshot
